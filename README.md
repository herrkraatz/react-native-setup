# Sorry !! Gosh ... 4 years went by.
I hope to find time soon to update this tutorial.

# React Native Setup

This tutorial shall help setting up your React Native environment and running your first React Native App.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: As of https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#getting-started the new way of getting started ...

- ... for Option 1 below is:

```
> npm install -g expo-cli
> expo init AwesomeProject
> cd AwesomeProject
> npm start
```

instead of

```
> npm install -g create-react-native-app
> create-react-native-app AwesomeProject
> cd AwesomeProject
> npm start
```

- ... for Option 3 below DO NOT USE:

```
> expo init AwesomeProject
> cd AwesomeProject
> npm run eject
```

But still use:

```
> react-native init my_rn_cli_project
```


### IMPORTANT CAUTION: 
The npm packages might have discovered vulnerabilities by now. 
So do not use the combination of our npm versions in your production environment, but within a test environment instead that is sandboxed from your production network.
Unfortunately the author has no time right now to always keep the npm packages at their latest versions and ensure that their combination still plays successfully together. The tuturial is supposed to show how it works and should help building working prototypes to make life easier for you.

## <a id="chapter1"></a>1. Getting Started - 3 Options

### Here are the 3 standard options how to set it up:

1. For a quickstart use both
    - `Create React Native App` (https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) as a boilerplate / base structure of your App
    - `Expo Client` (https://expo.io/) to do testing on your iOS / Android device or Simulators / Emulators
    
    To once leave the path of standard React Native Components / APIs you can "eject" from `Create React Native App`
    
2. For most convenience (pre-configured components like Camera, Push Notifications, etc through `Expo SDK`) and if you're sure that you DO NOT leave the path of standard React Native Components / APIs, use 
    - `Expo Development Server as GUI or CLI` (https://expo.io/),
        - as GUI: Download `Expo XDE` (https://github.com/expo/xde/releases)
        - as CLI: Install `Expo CLI` using `npm install exp --global`
    - `Expo Client` (https://expo.io/) to do testing on your iOS / Android device or Simulators / Emulators
    - `Expo SDK`:
        - Installation: `npm install --save expo`
        - List of components: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html (left column)
    
3. Advanced: If you need to integrate React Native into an existing native iOS / Android application OR want to create custom native modules beyond the standard React Native Components / APIs, 
    - you need to use `react-native-cli` along with Xcode and Android tools: See Tab "Building Projects with Native Code" on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
    - you need to "eject" from `Create React Native App` in case you initially started with `Create React Native App`: See https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md#ejecting-from-create-react-native-app


### Node.js installed ? Needed for all 3 options !

If you haven't Node.js installed on your machine, please install current (latest) version of Node.js ([By download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [By package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)).

*Note: LTS version is more stable, but better use latest version as React Native is under permanent development, and chances are pretty high that RN developers use (at least partly) latest Node.js features instead of taking care of time consuming regression tests for all older Node.js versions. RN developers, please forgive me if I'm wrong.*

This will install Node.js (JavaScript engine) on your machine, and allows JavaScript code to execute not only in your browser.
Node.js also ships with npm package manager we will need below.

*Notes:*

- No Mac needed, but tutorial was created using

    - Mac OS X version High Sierra, 10.13.4 (`sw_vers`)
    - Xcode Version 9.3
    - Node.js version v9.11.1 (`node -v`)
    - Watchman version 4.9.0 (`watchman -v`)
    - React Native CLI version 2.0.1 (`react-native -v`)

## <a id="chapter1a"></a>i. Quickstart with Create React Native App + Expo Client

### Install Create React Native App

Now we follow this tutorial: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Open a Terminal window and run:

```
> npm install -g create-react-native-app
```

When done, cd into your preferred projects root folder, and run:

```
> create-react-native-app AwesomeProject
```

When done, run:

```
> cd AwesomeProject
> npm start
```

This will start a development server for you with this output:

```
> npm start

> AwesomeProject@0.1.0 start /Users/User1/Desktop/Projects/react-native-setup/AwesomeProject
> react-native-scripts start

12:03:51 PM: Starting packager...
Packager started!

Your app is now running at URL: exp://192.168.14.18:19000

View your app with live reloading:

  Android device:
    -> Point the Expo app to the QR code above.
       (You'll find the QR scanner on the Projects tab of the app.)
  iOS device:
    -> Press s to email/text the app URL to your phone.
  Emulator:
    -> Press a (Android) or i (iOS) to start an emulator.

Your phone will need to be on the same local network as this computer.
For links to install the Expo app, please visit https://expo.io.

Logs from serving your app will appear here. Press Ctrl+C at any time to stop.

 › Press a to open Android device or emulator, or i to open iOS emulator.
 › Press s to send the app URL to your phone number or email address
 › Press q to display QR code.
 › Press r to restart packager, or R to restart packager and clear cache.
 › Press d to toggle development mode. (current mode: development)

```

Shortcut for iOS:

```
npm run ios
```

Documentation says: "Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed."

Shortcut for Android:

```
npm run android
```

Documentation says: "Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup)."

*Note:*
- If you run it the first time on a Simulator / Emulator, the Expo Client will be installed automatically on the Simulator / Emulator.


If you want to run it on a device, follow next step:

### Install the Expo Client App on your iOS or Android phone

iOS: Search for Expo Client in App Store and install it.

Android: Search for Expo Client in Play Store and install it.

Both: Connect to the same wireless network as your computer. 

On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. 
On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

### Debugging

Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. 
The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.

More details on setting up debugging on iOS Simulators / Android Emulators: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html


## <a id="chapter1b"></a>ii. For most convenience: Expo Development Server (as GUI or CLI) + Expo Client + Expo SDK (Components)

1. First install the Expo Client App on your iOS or Android phone

    iOS: Search for Expo Client in App Store and install it.
    
    Android: Search for Expo Client in Play Store and install it.

2. Install the Expo Development Server (as GUI or CLI) on your machine and run a first React Native App on your device

    *Note: Your device should be on the same WiFi connection as your machine to make Live Reloads fast. Also works with 3G on device, but is much slower.*
    
    We should try out both ways of starting your local Development Server:
    
    1. The `Expo CLI` first:
    
        ```
        > npm install exp --global
        ```
    
        We shouldn't worry about the warnings: https://forums.expo.io/t/installing-exp-without-warnings/8132/4
    
        Now create your first project, cd into the project folder, and run `exp start`
    
        ```
        > exp init my-new-project
        > cd my-new-project
        > exp start
        [12:40:12] Using project at /Users/User1/Projects/react-native-setup/my-new-project

        QR - CODE HERE                                                           
        
        [12:40:28] Your URL is: exp://ne-bhr.herrkraatz.my-new-project.exp.direct:80
        
        [12:40:28] Instructions to open this project on a physical device
        [12:40:28] Android devices: scan the above QR code.
        [12:40:28] iOS devices: run exp send -s <your-phone-number-or-email> in this project directory in another terminal window to send the URL to your device.
        
        [12:40:28] Instructions to open this project on a simulator
        [12:40:28] If you already have the simulator installed, run exp ios or exp android in this project directory in another terminal window.
        
        [12:40:28] Logs for your project will appear below. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
        
        ```
        
        Debugging on your Device:
        
        - `iOS Device`: 
        
            Run `exp send -s +49151.....` in the same project directory, but in another terminal window (DON'T CLOSE the window above !) to send the URL to your device.
            
            When the message arrived at your device, just click on the link and your first app gets opened within the Expo Client. 
        
        - `Android Device`:
        
            - Open Expo Client and scan the QR - CODE above
            - Or connect your Android device with an USB cable to your machine and run `exp android` in the same project directory, but in another terminal window (DON'T CLOSE the window above !).
        
        - `Both`: 
        
            Shaking your device shows the menu. Enable Live Reloading, so that each change in, e.g. in screens/HomeScreen.js will 
            automatically be reloaded on device for debugging.
    
        Debugging on Simulators / Emulators (see https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/workflow/debugging)
        
        - `iOS Simulator`: 
        
            Run `exp ios` in the same project directory, but in another terminal window (DON'T CLOSE the window above !).
            
            You need to have Xcode installed. 
            
            Then `Expo Client` gets installed on the Simulator, and opens the app within it.
               
        - `Android Emulator`:
        
            Run `exp android` in the same project directory, but in another terminal window (DON'T CLOSE the window above !).
            
            You need to have have `Genymotion` or `Android Studio` installed (IMPORTANT: see https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/genymotion). 
            
            Then `Expo Client` gets installed on the Emulator, and opens the app within it.
    
    2. Now the GUI `Expo XDE` (https://github.com/expo/xde/releases)
    
        Download and install the GUI, then sign in if you have signed up within the Expo Client already, otherwise sign up here.
        
        Then hit Project >> New Project >> Choose Blank or Tab Navigation and hit CREATE
        
        Debugging on your Device:
            
        - `iOS Device`: 
        
            Hit Share button (upper right corner) and hit "Send Link" to your mobile number `+49151.....`
            
            When the message arrived at your device, just click on the link and your first app gets opened within the Expo Client. 
        
        - `Android Device`:
        
            - Open Expo Client and scan the QR - CODE shown when you hit the Share button (upper right corner)
            - Or connect your Android device with an USB cable to your machine and hit Device button (upper right corner) >> "Open on Android"
        
        - `Both`: 
        
            Shaking your device shows the menu. Enable Live Reloading, so that each change in, e.g. in screens/HomeScreen.js will 
            automatically be reloaded on device for debugging.
        
        Debugging on Simulators / Emulators (see https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/workflow/debugging)
        
        - `iOS Simulator`: 
        
            Hit Device button (upper right corner) >> "Open on iOS Simulator"
            
            You need to have Xcode installed. 
            
            Then `Expo Client` gets installed on the Simulator, and opens the app within it.
               
        - `Android Emulator`:
        
            Hit Device button (upper right corner) >> "Open on Android"
            
            You need to have have `Genymotion` or `Android Studio` installed (IMPORTANT: see https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/genymotion). 
            
            Then `Expo Client` gets installed on the Emulator, and opens the app within it.
    
3. Finally install the `Expo SDK` (https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/sdk/) to take advantage of many many components (install it in your project root)

    ```
    > cd my-new-project
    > npm install --save expo
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    Importing `Contacts` component (https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/sdk/contacts) into your component:
     
    ```
    import { Contacts } from 'expo';
    ```
    
    Make sure you're using the most current SDK version. At the time of writing we were on Version 28.0.0

## <a id="chapter1c"></a>iii. Advanced: With react-native-cli + Xcode + Android Studio/Genymotion


### Before you start !

- iOS Setup: If you have Xcode installed, upgrade to latest version.

- Android Setup: If you have Android Studio installed, upgrade to latest version. It can also work WITHOUT Android Studio. Think about Genymotion, too.

- Both: Upgrade Node.js to latest version.


### Android Setup

Hit Tab "Building Projects with Native Code" on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Choose Target OS: Android

Follow instructions :)

You will need Watchman, JDK >= 8, React Native CLI, and either Android Studio or Genymotion

- Android Studio: Follow Tab "Building Projects with Native Code" on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
- Genymotion: Follow https://medium.com/surabayadev/setting-up-react-native-android-without-android-studio-35a496e1dfa3


### iOS Setup

iOS Projects are a bit easier to set up than Android Projects:

1. Install Watchman (also from facebook)

    ```
    > brew install watchman
    ```
    
    *Note:*
    This failed initially: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47513024/how-to-fix-permissions-on-home-brew-on-macos-high-sierra/47721925)
    Needed to run `sudo mkdir /usr/local/Frameworks` first.


2. Install React Native CLI

    ```
    > npm install -g react-native-cli
    ```

### Create first React Native App with React Native CLI

Now where all is set up, we can create our first React Native project using the React Native CLI.

CD into your preferred projects folder and let's call the app "my_rn_cli_project" (only alphanumeric values are allowed, no dashes)

```
> react-native init my_rn_cli_project
```

### Folder Structure

```

### Debugging

Debugging on Simulators / Emulators (see https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html):

- `iOS Simulator`: 
    
    1. To try it out on iOS Simulator first, cd into `my_rn_cli_project` and run:
    
        ```
        > cd my_rn_cli_project
        > react-native run-ios
        ```
        
        *Note:*
        This failed initially: 
        xcrun: error: unable to find utility "instruments", not a developer tool or in PATH (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39778607/error-running-react-native-app-from-terminal-ios)
        Needed to set Command Line Tools Path in Xcode >> Preferences >> Locations
        
        Also see Tab "Building Projects with Native Code" on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
       
     2. Hit CMD+D in the Simulator to open the Debugging Menu, then choose "Debug JS Remotely"; then Chrome opens and you can open the Console (ALT+CMD+I)
    
- `Android Emulator`:

    1. Setup for Android is a bit tricky. You can either use
    
        - Android Studio: Follow Tab "Building Projects with Native Code" on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
        - Genymotion: Follow https://medium.com/surabayadev/setting-up-react-native-android-without-android-studio-35a496e1dfa3

    2. When done, use
    
        ```
        > cd my_rn_cli_project
        > react-native run-android
        ```
                
    3. Hit CMD+M in the Emulator to open the Debugging Menu


Debugging on your Device (see https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html and https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html):

- `iOS Device`:

    1. First connect your device with the USB cable to your machine, then open Xcode Project `my_rn_cli_project/ios/my_rn_cli_project.xcodeproj` and hit Run.
        
        Toubleshooting: Also check out iOS - Tab on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html
        
    2. Shake your device to show Debugging Menu, then choose "Debug JS Remotely"; then Chrome opens and you can open the Console (ALT+CMD+I)
    
    3. Also check out https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html
    
    4. For cool Live Reloading feature (also in Debugging Menu) your device needs to be on the same WiFi network as your machine
    
    Suggestions:
    
    To have production conditions (or higher performance of you app) on your device, you should either 
    
    - disable Warnings, see https://codedaily.io/tutorials/5/Disable-the-Yellow-Box-in-React-Native
    - set Build Configuration to "Release" (Product >> Scheme >> Edit Scheme >> Run Tab)
    
- `Android Device`:

    1. First check out Android - Tab on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html
    
    2. Connect your device with the USB cable to your machine and run
    
        ```
        > cd my_rn_cli_project
        > react-native run-android
        ```
    
    3. Again check out Android - Tab on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html
    
    4. For cool Live Reloading feature (also in Debugging Menu) your device needs to be on the same WiFi network as your machine


### IMPORTANT: Debugging Tools for BOTH Simulator/Emulator AND Device !

- Check out Standalone React Developer Tools for a proper React "DOM tree" and more: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/packages/react-devtools
- Check out Standalone React Native Debugger for integrated React "DOM" manipulation and Redux: https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger

## <a id="chapter2"></a>2. Example React Native App with Firebase backend

The following app is a simple shift manager/planning app which includes

- Login/Signup Screen checked against Firebase backend
- An Employee List
- Shift Planning Screen
- Top Navigation

It is based on `react-native-cli`, but can easily be ported to Expo as we don't use any customized React Native Components.

Great many thanks to Stephen Grider who showed in his Udemy Course how to 
setup Firebase and Authentication with his React Native App "Manager" which is the basis of this repo (see links below).


### <a id="chapter2a"></a>i. Clone repository and preparation

1. First clone this repo into your preferred projects directory.

    Open a Terminal window and cd into your preferred projects directory, then run:
    
    ```
    > git clone https://github.com/herrkraatz/react-native-setup.git
    ```

2. When repo cloned successfully, cd into folder `react-native-setup` and run

    ```
    > react-native init manager_app
    ```

3. When done, copy `manager_app_src/src` into `manager_app` folder:

    ```
    > cp -R manager_app_src/src manager_app
    ```

4. Then copy `manager_app_src/package.json` into `manager_app` folder (replacing existing `package.json` file)

    ```
    > cp manager_app_src/package.json manager_app
    ```
 
5. Edit `manager_app/index.js` file:

    `import App from './App';` becomes `import App from './src/app';`
    
6. Delete `manager_app/App.js` file:

    ```
    > rm App.js
    ```
    
7. Finally cd into `manager_app` folder and run:

    ```
    > npm install
    ```

### <a id="chapter2b"></a>ii. Setting up your own Firebase account

Steps:

1. First go to https://firebase.google.com/ and create an account.

2. Then go to Console, and add a Project.

3. Enable "Email/Password" under Authentication >> Sign-in method

4. Add Rules to Realtime Database to protect your database from public inserting of data !

    Open Database >> Rules and insert
    
    ```
    {
      "rules": {
        "users": {
          "$uid": {
            ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        		".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. Go to Project Overview >> "Add Firebase to your web app" and copy the config parameters

    ```
    config = {
        apiKey: "AIzaSyD_bli",
        authDomain: "bli.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "https://bli.firebaseio.com",
        projectId: "bli",
        storageBucket: "bli.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "bla"
    };
    ```
    
    Then replace the config parameters in `manager_app/src/app.js` with the above copied config parameters.

  
### <a id="chapter2c"></a>iii. Run app on iOS Simulator

Now let's try it out on iOS Simulator !

Cd into `manager_app` and run:
    
```
> react-native run-ios
```

A cool side effect in Firebase is the visualization of live updates in its Realtime Database

Each time you insert/edit an employee, the employee pops up yellow under Database >> Realtime Database >> Data
        
Have fun being manager ! But don't fire too many of your peers !


#### Troubleshooting

If the App only shows up a second in the iOS Simulator, please open Xcode and you'll probably see this under the
General Tab: `Signing for "manager_app" requires a development team.`

Solution: 
- Hit Build Settings Tab and set Code Signing Identity >> Debug to your preferred Identity
- Then hit Play in Xcode
